# CV Webpage â€“ Naif Alghamdi

This repository includes several mini projects made with HTML and CSS.
The main one is my personal CV webpage.

Even though I'm still new to front-end development, I'm proud of how this project turned out in a short time.
It helped me apply many of the core concepts I've been learning.

### ğŸ’¡ What I learned and used:

- HTML5 & CSS3.
- CSS Frameworks.
- Responsive Design with Flexbox.
- Animations and Transitions.
- Pseudo-classes & Advanced Selectors.
- Unit of Measurements & Positions.
- Layout, Box Model.
- Downloadable CV (PDF)
